        <p><em>Basso Profundo and <strong>Guitar Player Extraordinaire</strong></em>.</p>
        <p>I have been singing and playing in folk groups and choirs since high school, With the Divine Infant choir in Ottawa, I have travelled to Italy, where we visited Assisi, sang at concerts in Florence and Rome, and for High Mass at St. Peters and
          during the Pope's general audience. I am looking forward to a similar journey with my current choir at St. Francis of Assisi in Raleigh as we travel to Austria and Germany for several Masses, concerts, and to attend the once-a-decade Passion Play
          presented in Oberammergau, Germany.
